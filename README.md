# express-oracleconnection
This is a copy of https://github.com/pwalczyszyn/express-myconnection slightly modified to work with Oracle.  @pwalczyszyn did all the real work, I just substituted Oracle for MySQL.

Initialization is done the same way as express-myconnection but only 'single' and 'pool' strategies are supported (pool is strongly recommended).
